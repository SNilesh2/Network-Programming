Mini Project: Echo Server

Project Overview
The objective of this project is to develop a simple Echo Server in C that returns the client's message along with the current timestamp and the number of messages bounced by the server so far. The intern will also develop a client program to interact with the server.

Features
Client-Server Communication: The server listens for messages from clients and sends back the same message.
Timestamping: Each echoed message includes the current timestamp from the client.
Message Counter: The server keeps track of the number of messages it has echoed and returns this count with each response.
Multi-client Support (Optional): The server can handle multiple clients simultaneously using threading.


Technologies Used
Programming Language: C
Networking: sockets 

Implementation Details

Echo Server:

Listens for incoming client connections.
Receives a message from the client.
Returns the message with the current timestamp (sent by the client) and the total number of messages echoed so far.
Uses a counter to track the total number of echoed messages.

Client Program:

Connects to the Echo Server using sockets.
Sends messages to the server.
Receives the echoed message, timestamp, and message count from the server.
Displays the received response.

Project Goals:

Learn fundamental client-server networking using sockets in C.
Implement a simple request-response mechanism.
Gain experience in handling multiple client requests.

Future Enhancements:

Implement logging of client messages and timestamps on the server.
Secure communication using encryption.
This project provides hands-on experience with socket programming and real-time message processing.
