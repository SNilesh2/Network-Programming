# TCP Echo Server and Client in C (Multi-threaded)

## Project Overview

This project implements a TCP-based Echo Server and Client using socket programming in C.  
The server receives messages from connected clients and echoes them back along with:

- The original message sent by the client  
- A timestamp generated by the client  
- The total number of messages processed by the server so far  

The server supports concurrent handling of multiple clients using POSIX threads (`pthread`).

## Objectives

- To understand basic client-server communication using TCP sockets  
- To learn multi-threaded programming using POSIX threads  
- To handle shared resources safely using mutex synchronization  
- To implement a simple request–response communication model  
- To gain practical experience in network programming

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: C  
- Networking: BSD Sockets (TCP)  
- Concurrency: POSIX Threads (`pthread`)  
- Platform: Linux / Unix-based systems
